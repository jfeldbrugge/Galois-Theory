<p><strong>Galois theory</strong> studies the solutions of the polynomial equations</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} x + a_n = 0,
\]</span></p>
<p>with a finite number of coefficients <span class="math inline">\(a_0,\dots,a_n\)</span> in the field <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a_0 \neq 0\)</span>. Famously, <strong>Abel-Ruffini’s theorem</strong> (1824) proves that this equation has only a general closed form solution for <span class="math inline">\(n\leq 4\)</span>. Vladimir I. Arnol’d developed a beautiful elementary proof of the solvability of polynomial equations using <strong>topological Galois theory</strong> (1963). This topological proof is much simpler than the more coventional proof using Galois theory. In the notes presented here, I will discuss Arnol’d’s proof of Abel-Ruffini’s theorem while keeping the discussion elementary. For simplicity, I will only consider polynomials over the complex number field <span class="math inline">\(K=\mathbb{C}\)</span>. I will only assume an elementary understanding of complex numbers and group theory. An expert might want to skip the more elementary sections.</p>
<p>Before going into the math, it is good to note that Abel-Ruffini’s theorem does not apply to particular polynomial equations with degree higher than <span class="math inline">\(4,\)</span> <em>i.e.,</em> the simple equation <span class="math inline">\(x^5 = 1\)</span> has well-known solutions <span class="math inline">\(x=e^{2\pi i k/5}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(k=0,1,2,3,4\)</span>. It rather discusses the extension of the <em>abc</em>-formula for higher-degree polynomial equations. Famously, the equation <span class="math inline">\(x^5 -x -1=0\)</span> is the simplest polynomial equation with no closed form solution in terms of a <strong>finite</strong> number of the usual elementary operations. Note that, using the equation <span class="math inline">\(x=\sqrt[5]{1+x}\)</span> (one of the roots), the solutions can be expressed as an infinite tower of nested roots</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x=\sqrt[5]{1+\sqrt[5]{1 + \sqrt[5]{1+\dots}}},\]</span></p>
<p>where the different values of the quintic root, chosen consistently, give the <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> distinct roots. Note that every complex root is multi-valued. As a consequence, an inifinite nested expression can generally assume an infinite number of values.</p>
<p>These notes are based on a series of lectures by V.I. Arnol’d delivered to secondary school students in Moscow (1963). A transcript of these lectures can be found in the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/1-4020-2187-9"> Abel’s Theorem in Problems and Solutions</a>. I also used the review paper by <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/topological-methods-in-nonlinear-analysis/volume-16/issue-2/The-topological-proof-of-Abel-Ruffini-theorem/tmna/1471875703.full"> Henryk Żolądek </a> and the talk by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eOw_TKsFXg&ab_channel=MichaelO%27Connor"> Michael O’Connor</a>.</p>
<h2 id="solvable-polynomials">Solvable polynomials</h2>
<p>Famously, only the linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials have general solutions in terms of a finite number of the elementary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, raising to a natural power, and taking the natural root) in terms of the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>. For completeness, I will here derive these solutions.</p>
<h3 id="the-linear-equation">The linear equation</h3>
<p>The linear equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a x + b =0,\]</span></p>
<p>has the unique solution <span class="math inline">\(x = -b/a\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="the-quadratic-equation">The quadratic equation</h3>
<p>The quadratic equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a x^2 + b x + c = 0,\]</span></p>
<p>has two well-known solutions expressed by the famous <em>abc-formula</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x_{\pm} = \frac{-a \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4 a c}}{2a}.\]</span></p>
<p>In this equation the discriminant <span class="math inline">\(\Delta= b^2 - 4 ac\)</span> determines whether the two roots are real <span class="math inline">\(\Delta &gt;0,\)</span> complex <span class="math inline">\(\Delta &lt;0,\)</span> or whether it is a double root <span class="math inline">\(\Delta =0\)</span>. Methods for solving quadratic equations date back to antiquity. It is well-known that Babylonian engineers worked with the quadratic equation in 2000 B.C. There is evidence for the <em>abc</em>-formula dating back to the Third Dynasty of Ursee (see <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781441960528"> Mathematics and Its History</a> by John Stillwell for more information).</p>
<p>Let’s for completeness derive the <em>abc</em>-formula. Upon division by <span class="math inline">\(a,\)</span> we obtain the monic quadratic equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(x) = x^2 + p x +q=0\]</span></p>
<p>for <span class="math inline">\(p=b/a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q=c/a\)</span>. Since the monic quadratic polynomial can be written in terms of the roots <span class="math inline">\(f=(x-x_+)(x-x_-)\)</span> (assume this for the moment or see proof below), we find the identities <span class="math inline">\(p = -(x_++x_-)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q = x_+ x_-,\)</span> known as <strong>Viète’s theorem</strong>. Using the symmetry of the parabola <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with respect to the mean of the roots <span class="math inline">\((x_+ + x_-)/2 = -p/2,\)</span> we write the roots as <span class="math inline">\(x_\pm = -p/2 \pm z\)</span> for some to be determined complex number <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Using the identity for <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> we find</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
q &amp;= (-p/2 + z)(-p/2 -z)\\
&amp;=p^2/4 -z^2,
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>by which <span class="math inline">\(z = \sqrt{p^2/4-q}\)</span>. The roots are thus</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x_\pm = \frac{-p\pm \sqrt{p^2-4q}}{2},
\]</span></p>
<p>or in the more familiar notation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x_\pm =\frac{-a \pm \sqrt{b^2 -4 a c}}{2a}.
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="the-cubic-equation">The cubic equation</h3>
<p>The cubic equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a_0 x^3 + a_1 x^2 + a_2 x +a_3=0,\]</span></p>
<p>assumes the generic form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x^3 + a x^2 + bx +c=0,\]</span></p>
<p>upon division by <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span>. Substituting <span class="math inline">\(x= y+d\)</span> (for a free number <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>),</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
0&amp;=(y+d)^3 + a (y+d)^2 + b(y+d) +c\\
&amp;=y^3 + (3d + a) y^2 + (3d^2+2ad + b)y + (d^3 + ad^2 + bd + c),
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>and selecting <span class="math inline">\(d=-a/3,\)</span> the equation reduces to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y^3 + p y + q = 0,\]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(p=a^2/3 + 2 ad + b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q =-a^3/27 + ad^2 + bd + c\)</span>. Writing a root <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(y_0=\alpha + \beta\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\beta\in \mathbb{C},\)</span> we obtain</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\alpha^3 + \beta^3 + (\alpha + \beta)(3\alpha \beta + p) + q = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>If we can find <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> such that they, in addition to <span class="math inline">\(y_0 = \alpha + \beta\)</span>, satisfy the relation <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \beta = - p/3,\)</span> (which is always possible since the combination of conditions yields a quadratic equation), the identity simplifies to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\alpha^3 + \beta^3= -q.\]</span></p>
<p>Raising the relation of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to the third power, we obtain an additional identity for the cubes of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta,\)</span> <em>i.e.</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^3 \beta^3 = - p^3/27.\)</span> Now using Viète’s theorem, the cubes <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^3\)</span> are the roots of the quadratic equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\omega^2 + q \omega - \frac{p^3}{27} = 0,\]</span></p>
<p>yielding the solutions</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\alpha^3 &amp;= -\frac{q}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} + \frac{p^3}{27}},\\
\beta^3 &amp;= -\frac{q}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} + \frac{p^3}{27}}.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the cubic root, with the requirement that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \beta = -p/3,\)</span> we obtain the three general solutions</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = \sqrt[3]{-\frac{q}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} + \frac{p^3}{27}}} + \sqrt[3]{-\frac{q}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} + \frac{p^3}{27}}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that we can interpret the square and the cube root to be double- and triple-valued. This makes the formula <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>-valued (<span class="math inline">\(3 \times 2 + 3 \times 2=12\)</span>), of which three unique values satisfy the cubic equation.</p>
<p>This formula is known as <strong>Cardano’s formula</strong>, named after the Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano who published the formula in the book Ars Magna (1545).</p>
<h3 id="the-quartic-equation">The quartic equation</h3>
<p>The quartic equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a_0 x^4 + a_1 x^3 + a_2 x^2 +x a_3 + a_4=0,\]</span></p>
<p>assumes the generic form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x^4 + a x^3 + bx^2 +c x + d=0,\]</span></p>
<p>upon division by <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span>. Setting <span class="math inline">\(x = y - a/4,\)</span> the quartic polynomial reduces to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y^4 + p y^2 + q y + r = 0,\]</span></p>
<p>for some <span class="math inline">\(p, q,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Using <strong>Ferrari’s method</strong>, we can write the left hand side as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left( y^2 + \frac{p}{2} + \alpha \right)^2 - \left[2\alpha\left(y^2 + \frac{p}{2}\right) + \alpha^2 - q y + \frac{p^2}{4} - r\right] = 0,\]</span></p>
<p>with the free number <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. Now, choose <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> such that the identity in the square brackets</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g = 2\alpha y^2 - q y + \left(\alpha p + \alpha^2 + \frac{p^2}{4} - r\right),\]</span></p>
<p>is a perfect square, <em>i.e.,</em> the discriminant vanishes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta =q^2 - 8 \alpha \left( \alpha p + \alpha^2 + \frac{p^2}{4} -r\right) = 0.\]</span></p>
<p>This is a cubic equation in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> which we can solve using Cardano’s formula. For one of the roots of the cubic equation <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_0,\)</span> we obtain the double root <span class="math inline">\(y_0 = \frac{q}{4 \alpha_0}\)</span> of the quadratic polynomial <span class="math inline">\(g,\)</span> <em>i.e.,</em> for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \alpha_0,\)</span> we obtain <span class="math inline">\(g=2\alpha_0(y-y_0)^2\)</span>. Substituting <span class="math inline">\(\alpha= \alpha_0,\)</span> the original equation assumes the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left( y^2 + \frac{p}{2} + \alpha_0\right)^2 - 2 \alpha_0(y-y_0)^2 = 0,\]</span></p>
<p>which is the difference of two squares, which enables us to factor the identity, <em>i.e.,</em> <span class="math inline">\(a^2-b^2 =(a+b)(a-b)\)</span>. Hence, using the cubic formula, we can write the quartic equation as the product of two quadratic equations which yield the solutions for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and the original quartic in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> using the <em>abc</em>-formula. We do not give a closed-form solution due to its length. This result is attributed to the Italian mathemetician Lodovico Ferrari, who was a student of Gerolamo Cardano. The quartic formula was published together with the cubic formula in the book Ars Magna (1545). In 1637, René Descartes developed an alternative derivation by factoring the quartic in terms of two quadratics <span class="math inline">\(x^4 + bx^3 + c x^2 + d x + e = (x^2 + sx + t)(x^2 + ux +v)\)</span> for numbers <span class="math inline">\(s,t,u,v\in \mathbb{C}\)</span>. Finding <span class="math inline">\(s,t,u,v\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(b,c,d,e\)</span> requires the solution of the cubic equation. In 1765, Leonhard Euler developed a variation on the Descartes method.</p>
<h2 id="unsolvable-polynomials">Unsolvable polynomials</h2>
<p>Given these achievements in renaissance Italy, the question arose whether these results extend to higher-degree polynomial equations. This does not turn out to be the case. In 1799, Paolo Ruffini constructed a proof for the unsolvability of higher-degree polynomials. However, the proof was long, incomplete, and not accepted by the mathematical community. In 1824, Niels H. Abel generated a complete proof of the statement. In 1832, the theory on solvable polynomials was further refined by Évariste Galois. We here present an elementary proof of <strong>Abel-Ruffini’s theorem</strong> by Vladimir I. Arnol’d (1963) using topological methods, which is considerably simpler than the original proofs.</p>
<p><strong>Abel-Ruffini’s theorem:</strong> <em>The generic algebraic equation of degree higher than four is not solvable by radicals, i.e., formulae do not exist for expressing roots of a generic equation of degree higher than four in terms of its coefficients by means of a finite number of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a natural power, and extraction of a root of natural degree.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-roots-of-polynomial-equations">The roots of polynomial equations</h3>
<p>Define a <em>curve</em> <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> by a continuous function <span class="math inline">\(\gamma:[0,1]\to \mathbb{C}\)</span> which parametrizes the curve, <em>i.e.,</em> <span class="math inline">\(C=\{\gamma(t)|t\in[0,1]\}\)</span>. The curve <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is called a <em>loop</em> whenever the endpoints coincide, <em>i.e.,</em> <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)\)</span>. We define the <em>winding number</em> of a loop with respect to a point <span class="math inline">\(p \in \mathbb{C},\)</span> which does not cross <span class="math inline">\(p,\)</span> as the number of times the loop travels counterclockwise around the point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Using Cauchy’s integral formula, we can formally define the winding number <span class="math inline">\(\nu_p\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\nu_p(C) &amp;=\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x - p} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_0^1 \frac{\gamma&#39;(t)}{\gamma(t)-p}\mathrm{d}t.
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The winding number of the unit circle, <span class="math inline">\(U(1)=\{x \in \mathbb{C} | |x|=1\}\)</span> traversed in the counterclockwise direction <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t) = e^{2 \pi i t},\)</span> with respect to the origin yields</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\nu_0(U(1)) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_0^1 \frac{\gamma&#39;(t)}{\gamma(t)}\mathrm{d}t=1.
\]</span></p>
<p>When traveling in the clockwise direction, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)=e^{-2\pi i t},\)</span> the winding number changes sign, <em>i.e.,</em> <span class="math inline">\(\nu_0(U(1))=-1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider a complex continuous function <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}\)</span> that maps every point <span class="math inline">\(z \in \mathbb{C}\)</span> to a unique point <span class="math inline">\(\omega = f(z) \in \mathbb{C}\)</span>. The function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps the curve <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to the curve <span class="math inline">\(f(C) = \{f(\gamma(t))|t\in [0,1]\} \subset \mathbb{C},\)</span> with the parametrization <span class="math inline">\(f \circ{} \gamma:[0,1]\to \mathbb{C}\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(\circ{}\)</span> is the composition operation). See figure 1 for an illustration. The winding number of the new curve, assuming it does not intersect the winding point, can differ from the winding number of the original curve. For example, for the unit circle <span class="math inline">\(C=U(1)\)</span> traversed in the counterclockwise direction and the elementary function <span class="math inline">\(f=x^n,\)</span> the curve <span class="math inline">\(f(C)\)</span> closes and the winding number with respect to the origin is given by <span class="math inline">\(\nu_0(f(U(1))) = n\)</span>. When the function is a root, <span class="math inline">\(f=\sqrt[n]{x},\)</span> the function will map the loop to a curve with distinct endpoints, <em>i.e.,</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{f(U(1))}\frac{ \mathrm{d}x}{x} = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_0^1 \frac{ \mathrm{d}(e^{2\pi i t /n})}{\mathrm{d} t} \frac{1}{e^{2\pi i t/n}}\mathrm{d}t= \frac{1}{n},
\]</span></p>
<p>where we selected the positive root for <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;0\)</span>. For the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root, it takes <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> resolutions around the branch point <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> to return to the original position on the original Riemann sheet (see more details below).</p>

<p>We can use the winding number of maps to prove that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root.</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental theorem of algebra:</strong> <em>The <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th degree polynomial, with <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> has at least one complex root. </em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>When <span class="math inline">\(a_n=0,\)</span> we find the root <span class="math inline">\(x_0=0,\)</span> as the polynomial factorizes trivially</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a_0 x^n + \dots + a_{n-1} x = x(a_0 x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1}).\]</span></p>
<p><em>When <span class="math inline">\(a_n \neq 0,\)</span> we use the fact that the constant function <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> has a vanishing winding number while <span class="math inline">\(a_0 x^n\)</span> has a winding number of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(A=\max(|a_0|,|a_1|,\dots,|a_n|) \geq |a_n| &gt;0,\)</span> and select two positive numbers <span class="math inline">\(R_1 &lt; \min\left(1, \frac{|a_n|}{10 An}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2&gt; \max\left(1, \frac{10 A n}{|a_0|}\right)\)</span> (where the factor <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> is an arbitrary positive number larger than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>).

<p><span class="math display">\[

&amp;\leq \frac{n A}{R_2}\\
&amp;\leq \frac{nA|a_0|}{10n A} = \frac{|a_0|}{10},

<p><em>where the first inequaility follows from the triangle inequaility, the second follows from <span class="math inline">\(|x| = R_2 \geq 1,\)</span> and the last follows from <span class="math inline">\(R_2 \geq \frac{10 A n}{|a_0|}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Now consider the winding number of <span class="math inline">\(f(C_R)\)</span> around the origin along the circle <span class="math inline">\(C_R = \{x \in \mathbb{C}| |x| = R\}\)</span> parametrized by the curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_R(t)=R e^{2\pi i t}\)</span>.

For large circles, <span class="math inline">\(R = R_2,\)</span> the highest order term of the polynomial dominates over the lower order terms.

Now as <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \left(\frac{f(x)}{x^n}\right) x^n,\)</span> we find that <span class="math inline">\(f,\)</span> like <span class="math inline">\(a_0x^n,\)</span> circles the origin <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times. The winding number <span class="math inline">\(\nu_0(C_{R_2}) = n,\)</span> as the parametrization <span class="math inline">\(f\circ{} \gamma_{R_2}\)</span> aquires a phase <span class="math inline">\(2\pi n\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>The winding number is a topological invariant as a continuous deformation of the curve will not change the number of times it circles <span class="math inline">\(0,\)</span> unless the curve at some point in the deformation passes through the origin, where it is not defined. This topological property follows from Cauchy’s integral theorem. Since the winding number is integer valued and changes while <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> in creases from <span class="math inline">\(R=R_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\nu_0(C_{R_1}) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_0(C_{R_2}) = n &gt; 0,\)</span> the intermediate value theorem proves that there must exist a <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(C_{R&#39;}\)</span> passes through <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. We have found a complex root of the polynomial equation without constructing the solution!</em></p>
<p>We can use this root <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> to write the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as a simpler polynomial <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> times <span class="math inline">\((x-x_0)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Bézout’s theorem:</strong> <em>If <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is a root of the equation <span class="math inline">\(a_0\, x^n+\dots + a_{n-1} x + a_n=0,\)</span> then the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f=a_0\ x^n+\dots + a_{n-1} x + a_n\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math inline">\((x-x_0)\)</span> without a remainder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can write the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in terms of a quotient polynomial <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and some remainder <span class="math inline">\(r\in \mathbb{C},\)</span></em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(x) = g(x)(x-x_0) +r.\]</span></p>
<p><em>We can find <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> by substituting <span class="math inline">\(x=x_0,\)</span> i.e., <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0) =r=0\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(x) (x-x_0)\)</span>. This proves Bézout’s theorem.</em></p>
<p>Consequently, we can write any polynomial as a product of linear factors.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>Any polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f = a_0\, x^n+\dots + a_{n-1} x + a_n\)</span> can be factorized as</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f=a_0(x-x_0)\dots (x-x_n)\]</span></p>
<p><em>with the roots <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in \mathbb{C}\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>By the fundamental theorem of algebra, know that the polynomial has a root <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. Using Bézout’s theorem, we can write <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(x)(x-x_0),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a polynomial of order <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>. By applying the fundamental and Bézout’s theorem to the quotient <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times, we obtain a factorization <span class="math inline">\(f = C (x-x_1)\dots (x-x_n)\)</span> with the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> roots <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Expanding the product, we find that <span class="math inline">\(C=a_0\)</span>. This proves the theorem. Note that when a root appears <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> times in this expression, the root is of order <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>It is often useful to define the space separable polynomials, for which all roots are distinct.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The space of separable polynomials is <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F}_n = \{a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{n-1} x + a_n | a_i \in \mathbb{C} \text{ with $n$ distinct roots}\}.\]</span></em></p>
<p>Using these results, we can prove that a continuous curve in the space of polynomials leads to continuous curves in the space of the roots. To discuss continuity in function space we define the distance between two functions <span class="math inline">\(\|f-g\|\)</span> as the distance of the coefficients in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^n\)</span>, <em>i.e.,</em> if <span class="math inline">\(f = a_0 x^n+\dots + a_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g = b_0 x^n+\dots + b_n\)</span>, we define <span class="math inline">\(\|f-g\|^2 = \sum_{i=0}^n |a_i -b_i|^2.\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>A continuous deformation in the space of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th degree polynomials leads to a continuous deformation of the roots.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> be a root of a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be a circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon&gt;0\)</span> centred at the root <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> by the image of the circle <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> by the function <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>. We can write <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(f_0=a_0(x-x_0)\dots (x-x_n)\)</span> with the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> roots <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>. A counterclockwise turn along the circle <span class="math inline">\(C,\)</span> does not change the path <span class="math inline">\((x-x_i) \circ{} \gamma\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> lies outside the disc <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> bounded by <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. The path <span class="math inline">\(f_0 \circ{} \gamma\)</span> does aquires a phase <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> for every root <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> inside the disk <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Hence, as we follow <span class="math inline">\(C,\)</span> the argument of the path <span class="math inline">\(f_0 \circ{} \gamma\)</span> increases by <span class="math inline">\(2\pi m\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> the number of roots inside the disk <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. As a consequence, the curve <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> loops <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times around the origin with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> the number of roots in the disk <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Since <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is a root of <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> there exists a real number <span class="math inline">\(\rho &gt;0\)</span> such that the disk of radius <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> centred at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> does not intersect the loop <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span>. Now consider a different polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> with a new image of the circle <span class="math inline">\(C_1=f_1(C)\)</span> and consider a continuous deformation <span class="math inline">\(f_s\)</span> (for <span class="math inline">\(s \in [0,1]\)</span>) deforming <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> (at <span class="math inline">\(s=0\)</span>) to <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(s=1\)</span>). The curve <span class="math inline">\(f_s(C)\)</span> continuously deforms the loop <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> to the loop <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> is chosen close enough to <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> there exists a deformation <span class="math inline">\(f_s\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f_s(C)\)</span> never intersects the disk centred at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Hence, the curve <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> circles the origin <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times, and the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> still has <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> roots in the disk <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.

This proves that a continous deformation of the polynomial leads to a continuous deformation of its roots.</em></p>
<p>Conversely, it follows from the decomposition of polynomials in terms of the roots, that a continuous deformation of the roots leads to a continuous deformation of the polynomial. Note that we managed to prove all these properties of roots using topological arguments without every any polynomial equations.</p>

<p>A polynomial is a single-valued function, <em>i.e.,</em> every point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is uniquely mapped to a point <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. This is not true for all functions. For example, the square root, defined as the inverse of the square <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> on the complex plane <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, is a doubly-valued function mapping a non-zero point <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{C}\)</span> to two values <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(x) = \pm \sqrt{x},\)</span> since both <span class="math inline">\((+\sqrt{x})^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((-\sqrt{x})^2\)</span> equate to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The important point in the study of roots is, that we cannot consider the one without considering the other. They are intimately connected. More generally, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[n]{x}\)</span> is multi-valued as it takes <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> values, exemplified by the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> roots of unity <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_k = e^{ \frac{2\pi i k}{n}}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(k=0,1,\dots, n-1\)</span> corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[5]{1}\)</span>. We will here only consider functions representable by radicals.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A function <span class="math inline">\(h(x)\)</span> is representable by radicals if it can be written in terms of the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x\)</span> and of the constant function <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = a \in \mathbb{C}\)</span> by means of a finite number of operations including the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to an integer power and extraction of a root of integer order</em></p>
<p>When several multi-valued functions are combined, the resulting function consists of all the possible combinations. Note that, when several of the combinations are coincide, we identify them with each other. A good example of functions represented by radicals is the <em>abc</em>-formula for quadratic, Cardano’s formula for cubic, and Ferrari’s formula for quartic equations. Note, in particular, the nested roots in Cardano’s formula.</p>
<p>To develop a better understanding of multi-valued functions it proves useful to extend the complex plane to the Riemann surface. For example, for the square root, we can take two copies of the complex plane <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, cut them from the branch point <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> to infinity (conventionally along the negative axis) and join the two Riemann sheets to construct the Riemann surface (see figure 3). The line along which the two sheets meet is known as the branch cut. To each Riemann sheet, we associate one of the values of the square root, <span class="math inline">\(+\sqrt{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-\sqrt{x}\)</span>. The square root is now single-valued on the Riemann surface. When crossing the branch-cut, we move from between the two sheets. This geometrically illustrates the fact that we need to circle the origin twice to return to the original position.</p>

<p>More general multi-valued functions lead to more intricate Riemann surfaces. The different ways in which a loop is mapped onto the Riemann surface is known as the monodromy group.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The monodromy group of a multi-valued function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a permutation group describing how points move between the Riemann sheets. Given a point <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-values <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-valued function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> Riemann sheets, consider the permutation of the <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>’s when traversing a loop starting and ending on <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. The set of all the permutations corresponding to all loops is the monodromy group <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span></em></p>
<p>Note that both the curves and the corresponding permutations are groups under the operation of composition</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
(\gamma_1 \gamma_2)(t) &amp;= 
\begin{cases}
\gamma_1(2t)  &amp;\text{ for } 0\leq t \leq 1/2,\\
\gamma_2(2t-1) &amp;\text{ for } 1/2\leq t \leq 1,
\end{cases}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>with the parametrizations of two curves <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1,\gamma_2:[0,1]\to \mathbb{C}\)</span>. The inverse reverses the direction of the curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^{-1}(t) = \gamma(1-t)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t\in [0,1]\)</span> and the unity element is the trivial loop <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t) = x_0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t \in [0,1]\)</span>. As it turns out, the monodromy group is independent of the starting and end point <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now prove a key property of the monodromy group of roots and functions representable by radicals. For the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}\)</span>, the Riemann surface consists of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> Riemann sheets corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> roots of unity <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>. A counterclockwise loop around the origin permutes the roots as <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i \mapsto \epsilon_{i+1}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=0,n-2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{n-1}\mapsto \epsilon_0\)</span>. A loop that turns <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times around the origin cycles the roots by <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> steps. A loop that does not cycle around the origin leaves the roots unchanged, inducing the trivial permutation. Hence, the monodromy group of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root is isomorphic to the cyclic group <span class="math inline">\(C_n\)</span>. More complicated functions representable by radicals lead to more intricate monodromy permutation groups. Using monodromy, we can thus Riemann surfaces using group theory!</p>
<p>Monodromy groups of functions containing roots can be quite complicated. However, as it turns out, there is only one key observation that we will need to proof Abel-Ruffini’s theorem. Given two loops <span class="math inline">\(C_1,C_2 \subset \mathbb{C}\)</span> with the parametrizations <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1,\gamma_2\)</span> and winding numbers <span class="math inline">\(\nu_0(C_1)= n_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_0(C_2)= n_2\)</span>, the winding number of the commutator</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[[\gamma_1,\gamma_2] = \gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1}\gamma_2^{-1}\]</span></p>
<p>vanishes (see figure 4).</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The winding number for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>. The winding number for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1 \gamma_2\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n_1+n_2\)</span>. The winding number for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n_1 + n_2 - n_1\)</span>. The winding number of the commutator <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1}\gamma_2^{-1}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n_1+n_2-n_1-n_2=0\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Note that this property applies equally well to arbitrary turning points.</p>
<figure>
<img src='figures/Monodromy.png' width=50% />
<figcaption>
Fig. 4 - The commutator of two curves does not circle points
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This leads us to the realization</p>
<p><strong>Key property 1:</strong> <em>Since the values of a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=\sqrt[n]{x}\)</span> cycle <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> steps between the Riemann sheets when the loop cycles <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> times around the branch point, the values do not switch between Riemann sheets when the loop can be written as a commutator of two loops.</em></p>
<p>This does not mean that the values of any multi-valued function representable by radicals are invariant under a commutator loop, since the root of the path can still cycle around the branch of another root. However, it does imply this property for functions without nested roots (such as the famous <em>abc</em>-formula).</p>
<p>To apply this property to general functions representable by radicals, including finite nested roots, we go one step further. As we saw above a loop which is the commutator of two loops is mapped by the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}\)</span>, to a general loop. Given two loops <span class="math inline">\(\delta_1,\delta_2\)</span> which are themselfs the commutators of loops, <em>i.e.,</em> <span class="math inline">\(\delta_1 = [\gamma_1,\gamma_2]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_2=[\gamma_3,\gamma_4]\)</span>, can be combined to construct an intricate loop</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
[\delta_1,\delta_2] &amp;= [[\gamma_1,\gamma_2],[\gamma_3,\gamma_4]] \\
&amp;= (\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1})( \gamma_3 \gamma_4 \gamma_3^{-1} \gamma_4^{-1}) (\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1})^{-1}( \gamma_3 \gamma_4 \gamma_3^{-1} \gamma_4^{-1}) ^{-1}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>whose image under the root <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> does not cycle around any point. As a consequence, it acts trivially on the values of a function with doubly nested roots such as Cardano’s formula. By iterating this procedure, we find the second key property.</p>
<p><strong>Key property 2:</strong> <em>For any function representable by radicals, the values of the function act trivially with respect to all loops constructed by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th levels of commutators of general loops. The smallest <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> for which this is true gives the level at which the function includes nested roots.</em></p>
<p>We can express this in neater notation using group theory. Given a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we can evaluate the monodromy group <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. By commuting all elements in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, we can construct the commutant group generated by the commutators</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K(M) = [M,M] = \{ [g_1,h_1][g_2,h_2] \dots [g_n,h_n] | g_i,h_i \in M\}.\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the commutant is a subgroup <span class="math inline">\(K(M) \subset M\)</span>. Starting with the first commutant <span class="math inline">\(K_1(M) = K(M)\)</span> we can construct a series of <strong>commutants</strong> using the identity <span class="math inline">\(K_{i+1}(M) = K(K_i(M))\)</span>, forming a chain of groups</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
M \supset K_1(M) \supset K_2 \supset \dots
\]</span></p>
<p>The monodromy group is called <strong>solvable</strong> when this chain terminates in the trivial subgroup after a finite number of steps, <em>i.e.</em> there exists a <span class="math inline">\(m \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(K_m(M) = \{e\}\)</span>. In group language <strong>key property 2</strong> states that the monodromy group of a function representable by radicals is solvable.</p>
<h3 id="proving-abel-ruffinis-theorem">Proving Abel-Ruffini’s theorem</h3>
<p>We now have enough theory to move back to the roots of polynomial equations and proof Abel-Ruffini’s theorem. From the properties of roots of polynomial equations proven above, it follows that a continuous curve <span class="math inline">\(f_t:[0,1]\to \mathcal{F}_n\)</span> in function space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_n\)</span> induces curves for the roots. We will now consider loops in function space, <em>i.e.,</em> paths for which <span class="math inline">\(f_0=f_1\)</span>, and study the corresponding trajectories of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> roots. Since the function at the endpoints of the trajectory <span class="math inline">\(f_t\)</span> coincides so will the roots. However, the curves of the roots are not necessarily loops themselves. The operation of the loop in function space can permutate the roots, similar to the behaviour we observed in the functions in including radicals. This is not surprising given the structure of the <em>abc</em>-formula. To determine whether the roots are expressable by radicals, we will determine the monodromy group of the roots and check whether this group is soluble.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>The permutation group of the roots of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th degree polynomial equation, under loops in function space in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}_n\)</span>, is the symmetric group <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> consisting of all permutations of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th degree polynomial can be written as <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=a_0(x-x_0)\dots(x-x_n)\)</span> with the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> roots <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. For any permutation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in the symmetric group <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> we can construct a continuous deformation that simultaneously permutes the roots accordingly (but never let the roots coincide). By expanding the product, we can write this deformation of the roots as a deformation of the polynomial. Since the ensemble of roots at the end of the deformation coincides with the original ensemble of roots, the deformation induces a loop in function space corresponding to this permutation. See figure 5 for an illustration.</em></p>

<h4 id="polynomial-equations-beyond-the-quartic">Polynomial equations beyond the quartic</h4>
<p>We can prove this more formally. First, we derive a simple property of the alternating group.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma:</strong> <em>For <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;2\)</span>, the alternating group <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> is generated by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The product of two <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cycles with coinciding elements is the identity element. The product of two <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cycles with one matching number is a <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycle, i.e., <span class="math inline">\((12)(23)=(123)\)</span>. The product of two disjoint <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cycles is equal to the product of two <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles, i.e.</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(12)(34)=(12)(23)(23)(34)=(123)(234).\]</span></p>
<p><em>Since every element in <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> is the product of an even number of transpositions, it consists of the product of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles</em></p>
<p>We can use this to find the commutant of the symmetric group.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>The commutant of the symmetric group <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> is the alternating group <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\([S_n,S_n]=A_n\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>Firstly, assume that <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 3\)</span>. Since we can write any <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycle <span class="math inline">\((123)\)</span> as a commutator of two <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cycles,</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
(123) &amp;=(132)^2\\
&amp;=((12)(13))^2\\
&amp;=(12)(13)(12)(13)\\
&amp;=[(12),(13)],
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p><em>the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles in <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> are in the commutant <span class="math inline">\([S_n,S_n]\)</span>. Using the lemma above, since the alternating group <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> is generated by the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles we conclude that <span class="math inline">\(A_n \subset [S_n,S_n]\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Next, consider the general commutator <span class="math inline">\([\sigma,\tau] = \sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \tau^{-1}\)</span> with the permutations <span class="math inline">\(\sigma,\tau \in S_n\)</span>. The commutator <span class="math inline">\([\sigma,\tau]\)</span> is an even permutation as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> has the same parity as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> has the same parity as <span class="math inline">\(\tau^{-1}\)</span> (if it takes an even (odd) number of transpositions to perform <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, it also an even (odd) number of transpositions to undo the permutation (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{-1}\)</span>). Since every element in <span class="math inline">\([S_n,S_n]\)</span> is even we find that <span class="math inline">\([S_n,S_n] \subset A_n\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Hence we have showed that <span class="math inline">\([S_n,S_n]=A_n\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 3\)</span>. It is straightforward to check the cases <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> (see the discussion of the linear and quadratic equation).</em></p>
<p>To conclude the proof, we evaluate the commutant of the alternating group <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 5\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>The commutant of the alternating group <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> is the alternating group for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 5\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\([A_n,A_n]=A_n\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 5\)</span>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>The commutator of the two <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles <span class="math inline">\((123)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((345)\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycle, i.e.,</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
[(123),(345)] &amp;= (123)(345)(123)^{-1}(345)^{-1}\\
&amp;=(143).
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p><em>Hence the commutant of <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> includes all <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles. Since the commutant can only decrease the size of a group and <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> itself is generated by all <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles, we conclude that <span class="math inline">\([A_n,A_n] =A_n\)</span>. This proves the theorm.</em></p>
<p><em>As a bonus, this proof fails for <span class="math inline">\(n \leq 4\)</span> since we do not have enough elements to permute to construct this commutator. We observed above that <span class="math inline">\(A_1=A_2= [A_3,A_3]=\{e\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([A_4,A_4]=V\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> the Klein four-group. The statement for <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> follows from the fact that there are no <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles. The statement for <span class="math inline">\(A_3\)</span> follows from the fact that there are only two <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles which are each other’s inverse and thus commute, i.e., <span class="math inline">\([(123),(132)]=e\)</span>. The statement for <span class="math inline">\(A_4\)</span> follows from the commutators of the form <span class="math inline">\([(123),(134)]=(12)(34)\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Hence <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 5\)</span> is not solvable and there does not exist a solution to these polynomial equations in terms of radicals. This proves Abel-Ruffini’s theorem abstractly using topology.</p>
<h4 id="notes-on-topological-galois-theory">Notes on topological Galois theory</h4>
<p>This topological proof is less powerfull in the sense that it does not decide whether a particular polynomial is solvable. However, it is more powerfull in that it shows that also exponential function cannot be used to construct solutions.</p>
